Super Slide Me is an Android puzzle game I developed back in 2014.

It was my first attempt at a bigger project
so the code is terrible. The game itself can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mygdx.ssm)

Couple of screenshots:

I've updated it in 2019 to work with latest gradle and gwt versions.
